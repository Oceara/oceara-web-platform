### **Method 2: Vercel Web Interface**

```
Framework Preset: Next.js

## 🆘 If Vercel STILL Shows Errors:

### **This means you have an OLD deployment cached.**

**FIX IT:**

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Find your project
   - Go to **Settings** (bottom left)
   - Scroll down → **Delete Project**
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Clear "Cached images and files"
   - Close browser completely

3. **Try Again:**
   - Open fresh browser tab
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import fresh

## 📱 Alternative: Deploy to Netlify (Even Easier!)

If Vercel keeps giving issues, try Netlify:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Click "Import from Git"
3. Choose GitHub → Select repository
4. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
5. Click "Deploy"

**Netlify often works better for Next.js!**
