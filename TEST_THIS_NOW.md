## 💡 WHY BROWSER CACHE IS THE ISSUE

**Vercel caches assets for 31 days:**
- JavaScript files: 31 days
- CSS files: 31 days
- Images: 7 days
- HTML: Varies

**Your browser ALSO caches:**
- Scripts: 31 days
- Styles: 31 days
- Data: Until cleared

**Solution = Force bypass both caches!**

**Incognito mode has NO cache!** ✅
