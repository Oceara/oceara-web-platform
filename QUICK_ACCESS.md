## 🔧 Troubleshooting "Page Not Found"

### If you see 404 error:

**1. Check the server is running:**
- Look at your terminal
- Should see: `✓ Ready in X seconds`
- Should see: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

**2. Restart the server:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal to stop
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

**3. Clear cache and restart:**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Delete cache:
Remove-Item ".next" -Recurse -Force
# Restart:
npm run dev
```

**4. Check the correct port:**
- If terminal shows `Local: http://localhost:3001`
- Use port 3001 instead: http://localhost:3001/admin

**5. Wait for compilation:**
- First visit to a page triggers compilation
- Watch terminal for: `✓ Compiled /admin in Xs`
- Then refresh the page

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Page Not Found" on /admin

**Possible Causes:**
1. Server still compiling
2. Port changed (3000 → 3001)
3. Cache issue
4. File not in correct location

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Solution 1: Wait and refresh
Wait 30 seconds, then press F5

# Solution 2: Check correct port
Look at terminal for "Local: http://localhost:XXXX"
Use that port number

# Solution 3: Hard refresh
Press Ctrl+Shift+R (clears cache)

# Solution 4: Restart server
Ctrl+C in terminal
npm run dev
Wait for "✓ Ready"
Refresh browser
```

### Issue: Supabase Error in Console

**This is NORMAL!** The error appears because Supabase credentials are not configured, but the app still works with the simple auth system.

```
Error: @supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required
```

**Solution:** Ignore it! The app works fine without Supabase for now.
